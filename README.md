# Bonfire
The end goal is to have an peer to peer chat application framework which run on cryptographically signed javascript scripts.

## Scripts

There will be two types of scripts, manager scripts, and plugin scripts. 

### Manager

The manager scripts will use an api provided by bonfire
to send and recieve message json objects. They will also do some basic display of these message json objects and manager the
running of the plugin scripts.
